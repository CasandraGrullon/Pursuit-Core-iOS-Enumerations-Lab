// Question One

// a. Define an enumeration called iOSDeviceType with member values iPhone, iPad, iWatch. Create a variable called myiPad and assign it to .iPad.

// Your code here
enum iOSDeviceType {
    case iPhone
    case iPad
    case iWatch
}

var myiPad = iOSDeviceType.iPad

// Uncomment the lines below to test your solution

myiPad = iOSDeviceType.iPad
assert(myiPad == .iPad)

// b. Adjust your code above so that iPhone and iPad have associated values of type String which represents the model number.  Create an instance of a .iPhone("8+") and assign it to a variable called myPhone

// Your code here
enum iOSDeviceType1b {
    case iPhone(model: String)
    case iPad(String)
    case iWatch
}

let myPhone = iOSDeviceType1b.iPhone (model: "8+")

// Question Two

// Write a function named getPosition(startingAt:afterSteps:) that takes an array of Steps, and a starting location of (Int, Int) and returns an (Int, Int) tuple representing the final position.

//A step .up will increase the y coordinate by 1.
//A step .down will decrease the y coordinate by 1.
//A step .right will increase the x coordinate by 1.
//A step .left will decrease the x coordinate by 1.


// Your function here

// Question Three

// You are given a Coin enumeration which describes different coin values. Write a function called getTotalValue(from:) that takes in an array of tuples of type (number: Int, coin: Coin), and returns the total value of all coins in cents.

enum Coin: Int {
    case penny = 1
    case nickle = 5

// Question Four

// Write an enum called Day to represent the days of the week with a raw value of type String.

// Question Five

//Define an enumeration named HandShape with three members: .rock, .paper, .scissors.
//Define an enumeration named MatchResult with three members: .win, .draw, .lose.
//Write a function called matchResult(fromPlayerOneShape:andPlayerTwoShape:) that takes two HandShapes and returns a MatchResult. It should return the outcome for the first player (the one with the first hand shape).
